# Rule: Enforce Consistent Command Practices

# This rule ensures terminal commands executed via the AI follow consistent practices
# to prevent errors and maintain best practices across the project.

<rule>
name: enforce_terminal_practices
filters:
  # Filter for when the run_terminal_cmd tool is about to be used.
  - type: tool_call
    pattern: "run_terminal_cmd"

actions:
  # React by providing instructions to the AI Assistant (me).
  - type: react
    action: |
      # 1. Prepend cd to project root before executing terminal command

      **RULE TRIGGERED: enforce_terminal_practices**

      Before executing the proposed terminal command, I MUST ensure it is prefixed with:
      `cd /home/jsnyde0/Documents/code/humble-clay/ && `

      **Reason:** To guarantee command execution within the intended directory and ensure reliable path resolution, preventing errors observed previously.

      # 2. Use UV for Python-related commands

      For Python commands, I MUST follow these practices:

      - Use `uv run pytest` instead of `python -m pytest` or direct `pytest` calls
      - Use `uv run python` instead of directly calling `python`
      - Use `uv pip install` instead of `pip install`

      **Reason:** UV provides better performance, dependency resolution, and consistent environment management.

      I will now modify the proposed command to include these requirements.

metadata:
  # Critical priority to ensure it's checked before every relevant command.
