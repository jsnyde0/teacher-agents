# Task: Implement Step Evaluator Agent

**ID:** TASK-2024-07-26-08
**Status:** üìù Open
**Date Created:** 2024-07-26

## Description

Implement a specialized agent, `Step Evaluator Agent`, whose sole purpose is to analyze a student's conversational message and determine their readiness to move to the next step in a learning plan. This agent provides a more robust mechanism for controlling lesson flow compared to simple keyword checking.

## Relevant Specifications

*   N/A - This is a new internal component supporting the teaching workflow.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] Create `src/agents/step_evaluator_agent.py`.
*   [ ] Implement a `create_step_evaluator_agent` function within this file.
*   [ ] Configure the agent with `result_type=Literal["PROCEED", "STAY", "UNCLEAR"]` to ensure constrained output.
*   [ ] Develop a clear and concise system prompt instructing the agent to analyze the student's message *only* for intent regarding progression:
    *   `PROCEED`: If the student clearly indicates understanding, completion, or readiness to move on.
    *   `STAY`: If the student asks clarifying questions about the current topic, expresses confusion, indicates they need more time, or is actively working on something related to the current step.
    *   `UNCLEAR`: If the student's message is ambiguous or off-topic regarding progression.
*   [ ] Create `tests/agents/test_step_evaluator_agent.py`.
*   [ ] Implement integration tests providing various sample student messages (e.g., "got it, next", "i have a question", "what about loops?", "ok", "hmmm let me think") and asserting the agent returns the correct corresponding literal (`PROCEED`, `STAY`, or `UNCLEAR`).
*   [ ] Ensure all tests pass.
