# Task: Implement Teacher Agent (MVP - First Step Execution)

**ID:** TASK-2024-07-26-07
**Status:** üìù Open
**Date Created:** 2024-07-26

## Description

Implement the MVP version of the `Teacher Agent`. This agent's primary responsibility in the MVP is to take the *first step* from a generated `LearningPlan` (provided as a descriptive string) and the `PedagogicalGuidelines` (as a string), and generate the initial conversational output to present that step's content or task to the student, adhering to the guidelines.

This task focuses *only* on initiating the execution of the first step. Handling multi-turn interaction within a step, checking for completion, or moving to subsequent steps are outside the scope of this MVP task.

## Relevant Specifications

*   `.cursor/specs/architecture/agentic_teacher_system.md` (Section 3.4)
*   `.cursor/specs/mvp/teacher_mvp_definition.md` (Section 3.4)

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] Create `src/agents/teacher_agent.py`.
*   [ ] Implement a `create_teacher_agent` function within this file.
*   [ ] The agent configuration (`system_prompt`, `result_type=str`) effectively guides the LLM to generate an appropriate conversational opening for the provided `plan_step` string, taking the `guideline` string into account (e.g., explaining vs. giving code first).
*   [ ] Include a basic integration test (`tests/agents/test_teacher_agent.py`) that:
    *   Provides a sample `plan_step` string and a sample `guideline` string as input context.
    *   Runs the agent.
    *   Asserts the output is a non-empty string.
    *   Asserts the output string's content clearly relates to the task described in the `plan_step` and aligns with the intent of the `guideline`.
