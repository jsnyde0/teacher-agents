## Description

Implement the initial, simple version of the `Onboarding Agent` using Pydantic AI as the first step towards building the Agentic Teacher system. The focus is on creating a verifiable first agent that can run in isolation.

## Relevant Specifications

*   `.cursor/specs/architecture/agentic_teacher_system.md` (Section 3.1)
*   `.cursor/specs/mvp/teacher_mvp_definition.md` (Section 3.1)

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [x] Define a Pydantic AI `Agent` class/instance for the `Onboarding Agent`.
*   [x] Define the `OnboardingData` Pydantic model as the agent's expected output.
*   [x] The agent, when run (potentially with mocked LLM calls initially), successfully produces an instance of the `OnboardingData` model.
*   [x] The agent code is located in a structured path (e.g., `src/agents/onboarding_agent.py`).
*   [x] Include a basic runner script or test to demonstrate the agent running successfully in isolation.

## Learnings

*   Pydantic AI's `Agent` with a well-defined `result_type` (Pydantic model) and a clear system prompt can effectively handle structured data extraction without complex parsing logic, relying on the LLM's capabilities.
*   Integration testing with a real LLM backend (like OpenRouter) early on helps verify the core functionality and configuration.
*   Python's import resolution for projects with `src` layouts requires specific handling (e.g., editable install, modifying PYTHONPATH, or adjusting script entry points).
