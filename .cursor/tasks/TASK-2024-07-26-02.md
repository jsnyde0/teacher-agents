# Task: Make Onboarding Agent Conversational

**ID:** TASK-2024-07-26-02
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Date Created:** 2024-07-26
**Date Completed:** 2024-07-26

## Description

Refactor the `Onboarding Agent` to move beyond single-shot data extraction. The agent should engage in a multi-turn conversation with the user, asking clarifying questions in a natural, friendly manner until it has confidently gathered all information required for the `OnboardingData` model (`point_a`, `point_b`, `preferences`). Only once complete should it output the final structured data.

## Relevant Specifications

*   Extends functionality described in:
    *   `.cursor/specs/architecture/agentic_teacher_system.md` (Section 3.1)
    *   `.cursor/specs/mvp/teacher_mvp_definition.md` (Section 3.1)

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [x] `Onboarding Agent` utilizes conversation history (`message_history` from Pydantic AI).
*   [x] Agent implementation includes logic/prompting to ask follow-up questions if `point_a`, `point_b`, or `preferences` are missing or unclear from the conversation history.
*   [x] Agent returns conversational text (`str`) responses during the information gathering phase.
*   [x] Agent returns the final `OnboardingData` structure *only* when it determines all necessary information has been collected.
*   [x] Integration tests (`tests/agents/test_onboarding_agent_integration.py`) are updated to simulate a multi-turn conversation reflecting this behavior.
*   [x] The Chainlit application (`app_chainlit.py`) is updated to handle the conversational turns, displaying agent questions and only showing the final structured data when received.

## Learnings

*   Using `Union[str, PydanticModel]` as `result_type` allows an agent to conditionally return either conversational text or structured data.
*   System prompts need clear instructions on *when* to switch from conversational output to structured output.
*   Testing conversational agents requires simulating multi-turn interactions and managing history.
*   Assertions on LLM conversational output should focus on intent/keywords rather than exact phrasing to avoid brittleness.
*   UI frameworks like Chainlit need explicit state management (e.g., `cl.user_session`) to handle conversation history across multiple requests.
