# Task: Integrate JCA Handoff in Chainlit

**ID:** TASK-2024-07-26-06
**Status:** 📝 Open
**Date Created:** 2024-07-26

## Description

Modify the Chainlit application (`app_chainlit.py`) to implement the programmatic hand-off from the `Pedagogical Master Agent` (PMA) to the `Journey Crafter Agent` (JCA). After the PMA generates `PedagogicalGuidelines`, the application logic should automatically trigger the JCA using both the original `OnboardingData` and the `PedagogicalGuidelines` as input to generate the `LearningPlan`.

## Relevant Specifications

*   Implements the PMA -> JCA hand-off step defined in `.cursor/specs/mvp/teacher_mvp_definition.md` (Section 4).
*   Integrates agent developed in `TASK-2024-07-26-05`.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] `@cl.on_chat_start` in `app_chainlit.py` initializes the JCA instance and stores it in the user session.
*   [ ] User session is used to store `OnboardingData` after OA completes successfully.
*   [ ] Logic handling the PMA result (currently in `run_pedagogical_master` or the main `@cl.on_message` block) is updated:
    *   [ ] If PMA successfully returns guidelines, store them (e.g., in user session or pass directly).
    *   [ ] Retrieve the stored `OnboardingData`.
    *   [ ] Construct the input prompt for the JCA using `OnboardingData` and `PedagogicalGuidelines`.
    *   [ ] Retrieve the JCA instance and call its `run` method.
    *   [ ] Print the resulting `LearningPlan.steps` to the console.
    *   [ ] Update the Chainlit UI message to display the generated learning plan steps.
    *   [ ] Add basic error handling for the JCA call.
*   [ ] The existing OA -> PMA flow remains functional.
