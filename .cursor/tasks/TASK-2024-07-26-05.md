# Task: Implement Journey Crafter Agent (MVP)

**ID:** TASK-2024-07-26-05
**Status:** âœ… Done

## Description

Implement the MVP version of the `Journey Crafter Agent`. This agent takes the `OnboardingData` and `PedagogicalGuidelines` as input and generates the initial `LearningPlan`, which is a structured sequence of learning steps.

## Relevant Specifications

*   `.cursor/specs/architecture/agentic_teacher_system.md` (Section 3.3)
*   `.cursor/specs/mvp/teacher_mvp_definition.md` (Section 3.3)

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [x] Define Pydantic models for `LearningPlan` (initially `List[PlanStep]`, simplified to `List[str]` for MVP) in `src/agents/journey_crafter_agent.py`.
*   [x] Implement a `create_journey_crafter_agent` function within `src/agents/journey_crafter_agent.py`.
*   [x] The agent configuration (`system_prompt`, `result_type=LearningPlan`) guides the LLM to generate a relevant sequence of steps based on `OnboardingData` and `PedagogicalGuidelines` inputs.
*   [x] Include a basic integration test (`tests/agents/test_journey_crafter_agent.py`) that:
    *   Provides sample `OnboardingData` and `PedagogicalGuidelines` as input context.
    *   Runs the agent.
    *   Asserts the output is a valid `LearningPlan` instance.
    *   Asserts the `LearningPlan` contains a non-empty list of steps (strings for MVP).
    *   Asserts that each step string is non-empty.

## Learnings

*   Generating complex nested structures (like lists of objects) can be challenging for LLMs, sometimes requiring multiple prompt refinements or simplification of the target schema.
*   Simplifying the output schema (e.g., `List[str]` instead of `List[PlanStep]`) can be a pragmatic way to overcome LLM formatting issues, especially in early stages.
*   Debugging LLM structured output failures often involves inspecting the raw response, understanding the validation error, and iteratively refining the prompt or schema.
*   Request timeouts can occur for complex generation tasks; increasing client timeouts or choosing faster models might be necessary (though not needed after simplification here).
