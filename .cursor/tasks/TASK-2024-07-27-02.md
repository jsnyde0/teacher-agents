# Task: Implement Answer Evaluation Agent

**ID:** TASK-2024-07-27-02
**Status:** âœ… Done
**Date Created:** 2024-07-27
**Date Completed:** 2024-07-27

## Description

Create a specialized agent responsible for evaluating the correctness and relevance of a student's response based on the context provided by the teacher's last instruction/question and the overall goal of the current learning step. This agent will provide structured feedback to the main application flow, separating the evaluation logic from the pedagogical response generation.

## Relevant Specifications

*   N/A - New internal component.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   [ ] Create `src/agents/answer_evaluator_agent.py`.
*   [ ] Define a Pydantic `BaseModel` named `AnswerEvaluationResult` within the file:
    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    from typing import Literal

    class AnswerEvaluationResult(BaseModel):
        evaluation: Literal["correct", "incorrect", "partial", "unclear", "not_applicable"] = Field(..., description="Categorization of the student's answer correctness/relevance.")
        explanation: str = Field(..., description="Brief explanation for the evaluation (e.g., why it's incorrect, or confirming correctness). Max 1-2 sentences.")
    ```
*   [ ] Implement a `create_answer_evaluator_agent` function within this file using `AnswerEvaluationResult` as the `result_type`.
*   [ ] Define an effective system prompt instructing the agent to:
    *   Receive `Teacher's Last Instruction/Question`, `Student's Response`, and `Current Learning Step Goal` as input context.
    *   Compare the `Student's Response` against the `Teacher's Instruction` and `Learning Step Goal`.
    *   Determine the appropriate `evaluation` category.
    *   Provide a concise `explanation` for the evaluation.
    *   Output *only* the structured `AnswerEvaluationResult` object.
*   [ ] Create `tests/agents/test_answer_evaluator_agent.py`.
*   [ ] Implement integration tests covering scenarios for `correct`, `incorrect`, `partial`, `unclear`, and `not_applicable` evaluations based on sample inputs.
*   [ ] Ensure all tests pass.
