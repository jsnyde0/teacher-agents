# Welcome to Your AI Tutor! 🧑‍🏫✨

Hi there! I'm an AI assistant designed to help you learn new technical skills.

To get started, please tell me a bit about:

1.  **What you already know** (your "Point A")
2.  **What you want to learn** (your "Point B")
3.  **How you prefer to learn** (e.g., through examples, projects, theory first?)

Based on your answers, I'll create a personalized learning plan and guide you through it step-by-step.

Let's begin! Just type your answers in the chat below.
